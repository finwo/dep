__NAME
======

General purpose dependency manager, with a slight focus on static C libraries

Usage
-----

```
<!-- #include "src/command/help/topic/global.txt" -->
```

Installation
------------

To install __NAME, simply download [dist/dep](dist/dep) and place it in your
`/usr/local/bin` directory or anywhere else that's included in your `$PATH`.

Building
--------

Building this dependency manager requires
[preprocess](https://pypi.org/project/preprocess/) which you can install by
running `pip install preprocess`.

After fetching the preprocess dependency, you can build & install dep by running
the following commands:

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

To install the binary in a location other than `/usr/local/bin`, pass the
`DESTDIR` definition to the `make install` command (default: `/usr/local`).
